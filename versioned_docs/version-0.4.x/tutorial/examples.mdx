# Example applications

## Example for `dash` users

When the package `dash_json_grid` is installed, users can test the following example
application:

<p>
  <DarkButton to={rootURL("usage.py")} icon={mdiLanguagePython}>
    {"usage.py"}
  </DarkButton>
</p>

This application provides the following features:

1. An input box for searching and highlighting the keywords in the data.
2. A dropdown menu (selecting box) for change the themes.
3. By selecting a part of the data, the selected path and value will be catched and
   shown.
4. If a number is selected, make that number value increased by `1`.

The other features are already mentioned in the [usage guides](/docs/category/usages).
Besides, this demo application provides an example of catching and updating the
selected **value** by using the `selected_path` from the callback.

```python title="usage.py" showLineNumbers
...
@callback(
    Output("selected-path", "children"),
    Output("selected-val", "children"),
    Output("viewer", "data"),
    Input("viewer", "selected_path"),
    State("viewer", "data"),
)
def display_output(route, data):
    if not route:
        return None, None, dash.no_update

    sel_data = dash_json_grid.DashJsonGrid.get_data_by_route(data, route)
    if isinstance(sel_data, (int, float)):
        sel_data_new = sel_data + 1
        dash_json_grid.DashJsonGrid.update_data_by_route(data, route, sel_data_new)
        return str(route), str(sel_data_new), data

    return str(route), str(sel_data), dash.no_update
...
```

where [`get_data_by_route`](../apis/DashJsonGrid.mdx#-get_data_by_route) and
[`update_data_by_route`](../apis/DashJsonGrid.mdx#-update_data_by_route) are class
methods. They are used for locating the specific part of the `data` by `route`, and
updating the part located by `route`, respectively.

:::info

Class methods like [`get_data_by_route`](../apis/DashJsonGrid.mdx#-get_data_by_route)
are provided by this dash component implmentaion exclusively. In other words, if you
are using [`react-json-grid`<IconExternalLink/>][git-react-json-grid], you need to
implement the logics of getting or updating values by yourself.

:::

## More examples

We provide more examples in the [API document](../apis/DashJsonGrid.mdx#examples).
Check that part to view some useful code snippets.

## Example purely based on React

:::warning

This example can be only used when you are developing the source project. In other
words, the React version is a developer-only example.

:::

To launch this example, please ensure that the following dependencies are available

- [Git<IconExternalLink/>][link-git]
- [NodeJS<IconExternalLink/>][link-nodejs]
- [Yarn<IconExternalLink/>][link-yarn]

After that, clone the project and run the demo by:

```shell
git clone -b v0.4.3 https://github.com/cainmagi/dash-json-grid
cd dash-json-grid
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt -r tests/requirements.txt
yarn install
yarn start
```

Overall, this example has most features of the `usage.py` demo. However, since it is
purely implemented React, in this example, we do not provide the features of getting
and updating the selected value.

:::info

For somehow, the demo in the [Introduction](../introduction.mdx) section is the same
thing of this example. However, due to the limitation of the document, the live demo
in this document is always synchronized with the newest version even if you choose
an older version of the document. If you want to check the exact behavior of the
legacy version, it is better to run the demo.
